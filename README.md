Node.js Express Movie Project
About the Project
The Node.js Express Movie Project is a web application built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a list of movies. This project is designed to demonstrate backend development skills, including RESTful API creation, database interactions, and server management.

Features
✅ Perform CRUD operations on movies (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
✅ RESTful API endpoints
✅ Integration with MongoDB for data storage
✅ Basic error handling and validation
✅ Organized project structure with MVC architecture
✅ Basic server setup with Express.js
✅ Routes for managing movies and controllers for handling business logic

Technologies Used
Node.js - JavaScript runtime for backend development
Express.js - Web application framework for Node.js
MongoDB - NoSQL database for storing movie data
Mongoose - ODM (Object Data Modeling) for MongoDB
Postman - For API testing (if applicable)

Installation & Setup
1.Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/saraswathi2015/Nodejs-Express-Movie-Project.git

2.Navigate into the project directory:
cd Nodejs-Express-Movie-Project

3.Install dependencies:
npm install

4.Set up the MongoDB connection (either locally or use MongoDB Atlas for a cloud database). Update the connection string in the app.js or server.js file.

5.To start the server:
node server.js
The API will be available at http://localhost:3000/

6.To test the API:
Use tools like Postman or curl to make requests to the endpoints such as:

GET /movies - Get the list of movies
POST /movies - Create a new movie
PUT /movies/:id - Update an existing movie
DELETE /movies/:id - Delete a movie

Usage
The project exposes RESTful API endpoints for performing CRUD operations on movies.
Users can interact with the API using HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
The database stores information about movies such as title, director, genre, release date, etc.
